# Sentiment Classification: ML & DL Approaches

## Approach
This project explores sentiment classification using both traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The ML approach uses algorithms like Logistic Regression and SVM, while the DL approach leverages neural networks such as LSTM.

## Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

## Results
Both ML and DL models were evaluated on the test dataset. Deep Learning models (LSTM) achieved higher accuracy and better generalization compared to traditional ML models. Detailed results and comparisons are available in the respective notebooks in the `Approaches` folder.
